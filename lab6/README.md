The first steps I took for this lab was implementing each math operation required. Starting off with the given code, I handled all the operations that require two operands, and then I implemented the operations that only take one input. Distinguishing between one/two input operations using the pre-existing logic required me to pass in an extra argument when constructing a new object. Once I figured out how to implement the math and made sure the result was output, I started adding extra to the calculator. Firstly, I used css to make the page look like the TI-108 calculator that is commonly found in schools. I then used javascript to implement extra functionality to the calculator. I have a number pad so that whenever the user presses the indicated number, the  value will appear on the interface. Because I have two input fields, I also made a left and right arrow key so that the user can control which field the buttons input to. I created a clear and delete button which erases the entire field and removes the last digit, respectively. Because some of the values can become large, I incorporated the overflow property so that you can view the entire number unlike regular calculators. Lastly i created an "off" button which cleared the content of the left, right, and result text fields.
