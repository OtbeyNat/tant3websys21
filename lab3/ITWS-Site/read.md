For the ITWS website, I started with a home page that branches off to 5 other pages: programs, faculty, news, social media, and contact. For the landing page, I prioritized having as little content as possible to show the user the different sections of the site. I added a background image to the body which set up the color palette of the site. On the landing page I used hover features and css transitions to change the size and color of the font of the buttons that take me to different pages. Unlike the other pages, the landing page has no navigation bar. I used CSS to make the navbar stay in the window even if the user scrolls down. On the programs page, I used javascript to toggle the display of the different sections and used the same hover to change the color of the elements. The faculty section, which arguably took up the most of my time, shows all of the faculty and their pictures. You can click on their pictures to go to a separate page. On this individual page you can hover over the image and it will flip to reveal information on the person (like a card). Initially I wanted to be able to have the flip feature for all of the faculty on one page, but the elements were stacking on top of each other. I realized the absolute position was causing this problem and so I decided to keep them separate - using the absolute position allowed me to put the front of the "card" and back of the card" on top of each other. Another issue I ran in to with the absolute positions was that the background of the elements dissappeared. I had set both the front and back elements of the card to absolute, but to fix this I only set one of them; this way the background of the cards would be there. The news page follows very closely to the CSS features of the programs page which include the color transitions. Like the other pages, the social media page uses hover to increase the size of the social media platforms' logo. For the contact page, I kept the content exactly the same but made subtle changes to the form. The input form looks more aesthetically pleasing with the addition of shadows and colors.
