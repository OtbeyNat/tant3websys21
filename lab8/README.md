For this lab, I admittedly struggled with the format of my json file. I was trying to use an array of objects to distinguish between all of the labs and all of the lectures. What I ended up doing was making each tier of the json document an array. The top tier websys_course is an array holding two arrays: one labs and another lectures; both of these are arrays themselves holding the objects of each individual set of data. Once I was able to figure out how to format the json document, the next obstacle was figuring out how to retrieve data from said json file. Figuring out the syntax for how to call specific objects in my json file required a lot of trial and error but I was eventually able to do so. Once I was able to retrieve said json data from the file with ajax, I went down the list tackling the requirements for the lab. I made a navigation bar on the left of the page that would open and close when clicking a specific button. For each item in the navigation bar, I made a javascript function that would display the data in the preview area. Afterwards I made the refresh button delete everything in the navigation bar and make the ajax call again. For the backend I reused the same code from class but changing the code to use PDO. The logout button was implemented and before viewing the main page the user has to log in first. Implementing an archive function had some challenges as well because I had to take the json data and somehow make of use of it in PHP and insert is into my database. Luckily, the json decode function in php made my life so much easier and converted the data into an associative array so that i can easily access and value in the file. I made two tables, one for labs and another for lectures and made columns for a title, description and link. I simplified the users table for the lab to include a name, username, and password column so that we are able to log into the site.
