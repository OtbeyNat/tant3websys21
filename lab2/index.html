    Welcome to the main page of our site. This website is mainly intended for college students who do not want to spend as much time reading large pieces of text. You can use the navigation bar to observe the constitution and the amendments. 

    Additionally, each section has a few helpful videos for those who are visual or auditory learners. These can also be used to help reinforce the concepts for each section, article, or amendment.
