        <p>You need a search warrant to check houses, people, etc. This can sometimes be a slippery slope depending on the case. What's interesting is that even when a person is found guilty of something, they can still file a case for unreasonable search if there was no solid evidence to conduct a search in the first place.</p>

        <p>20 dollars! That's all it takes in a lawsuit for there to necessitate a jury. Personally, I think that the amount is still small when it comes to matters such as litigation, so perhaps this amendment is a bit outdated (due to inflation and other economic changes).</p>

        <p>This is pretty self-explanatory. It makes sense for the fine and/or punishment to match the crime. One interesting thing is the idea of what "cruel and unusual" punishment means, especially because it is subjective. There were some cases in which this actually became an ethics issue - a pretty hot topic in death sentence trials.</p>
