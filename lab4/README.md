For Lab 4, the Gamma Nu Eta website, I concentrated on the CSS and HTML of the site. We based the color palette of our site off of the ITWS logo; which explains the tan, blue, and darker shades of green. I worked on the footer for the site, I wanted to keep it relatively simple and have subtle animations when hovering over a link. The most difficult part of the footer was figuring out the animations for the social media buttons. The trick with the animations was to make the left and right bordersof the icon transparent to give the appearance that the border has shifted and went away; using the rotate property also adds the spin animation whenever I hover. I used bootstrap for find the social media and envelope icons that are seen in my footer. 
I worked on the events page for the site and for me it was important that the content was the main focus of the tab. The issue for me during this process was that I did not have a lot of information to go off of; looking online I could hardly find information about the GNH newsletter. I had to pull information from my own email about GNH tutoring and prior experience with the company expose. I wanted to include more relevant images to diversify the content, but I could also not find such content. With regards to the AJAX and json, our group used json to take duplicate content from our site(header,navigation bar, and footer) in order to manipulate our html pages.
If I had more time, I would have like to stylize the page with more CSS and animations but frankly the social media icons took up a lot of my time.
