At the very beginning of this lab, I would say I was very stuck on what I needed to do. I spend a good portion of time reviewing HTML, and CSS because I have not been practicing or applying these skills since intro to ITWS. One of the smartest decisions Emily, and our group, made was to do our work collaboratively and in real-time on repl.it. We were able to see each others edits in real time and they automatically saved. Considering the work I did for this lab, I was able to contribute to our group portfolio index page in a couple ways. I formatted our page so that we can view our three previous works side by side. Additionally, I incorporated images for our previous works and my individual photo. The previous resume that I made in HTML was extremely outdated so I had to spend a lot of time fixing and updating it with current information. Given our group's overall minimal experience with HTML and CSS, I think the progression of work was fairly slow because we spent a lot of time looking at tutotrials online. I looked a lot into CSS and I struggled a little to figure out how to format the webpage to be how I wanted it to. The group labored to make the webpages look presentable and to edit our portfolios to have the appropriate requirements. Two things that our group discussed together was moving all CSS into one file and researching hcard microformats. We incorporated a navigation bar that is accessible at any point in the website. At the end of this lab, I feel a little more confident and getting back into the swing of things.
