To preface this, I am dissappointed in myself for my effort on this quiz. After answering the written questions, I looked into how to retrieve the JSON data and place them on HTML using AJAX. To no avail, I could not figure out how to do it and it took up a lot of my time. In retrospect, I definitely should have prepared more for this quiz, and I walk away from these two hours with not much to look at. What you currently see in the repo is taken code from my previous lab website in a haste attempt to at least have something put together.
What you can see currently from the page is a title and a brief line of what the application should do. I have the 5 currencies I wanted to do organized in a table each with css effects and animations on hover.
I suppose I can type out what I wanted to do for the application. Once I was able to retrieve the JSON data, I would have 5 buttons displayed in one row, each labeled with a specific currency. Similarly to how I used the flip CSS animations for my ITWS site, I would have the buttons flip over to reveal the rate of the given currency. On top of them I would have had an image of their associated country. 
I'm expecting an extremely poor grade for my quiz, but all I can say is that I will make an effort to do better and practice more.
I understand that this is not what you were looking for in the read me file, but this is what I have to unfortunately offer.
