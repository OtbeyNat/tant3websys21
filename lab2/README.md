Lab 2

For Lab 2 I made the content of the Amendments accessible via detail and summary tags. I included every Amendment and their respective content and made sure that the dropdown format was consistent throughout the page. Our group decided that we wanted to be able to view a popup of the summary of the Amendment and/or Article by hovering over the title. I added these popup summaries to each Article of the Constitution and each of the sections with in the Article. One of the main issues we had was that the summary that popped up was not at the front of the page relative to the other elements around it. For example, when we hover over "First Amendment", the "Second Amendment" text was still visible - which was not the intended result. After lots of searching and experimenting, I remembered there was a simple CSS property to fix this issue: z-index. By setting the z-index of our summary to 100, it will always appear over every other element on the page. Whenever you hover over a title that has extra analysis, I added a property so that the title/block has a yellow border around it. The border and summary that shows underneath line up without interefering with one another.
